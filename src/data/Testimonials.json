        "testimonial": "Nick worked with me to create the perfect website. After years of never being completely happy with how my site looked and not really knowing how to get it to how i envisioned myself, I found nick told him everything i visioned for the site and he created it! Once i had given all my requests nick recommended using the Gatsby framework which would ensure i have a speedy site. I would highly recommend as he works well together with you listening to exactly what you want and keeping you in the loop with what he thinks would and wouldn't work well. He is very easy to work with, happy to answer all email requests and very patient when teaching a very non tech/coding savy person how to navigate their way through and make tweaks and edit the site. I am loving my new rebranding and it looks great on all my devices :)"
